# Notes on Ingestor Function

### Note on Testing

In order to to help make the testing of this app easier `export` has been used on functions that are only called within the `index.ts` file of the `ingestor` function directory. A better testing strategy would probably need to be implemented for a production deployment although I am not super worried about the abstraction of these functions.
